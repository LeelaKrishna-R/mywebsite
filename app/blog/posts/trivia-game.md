## 📌 Overview
This project introduces a **contemporary trivia game** that generates questions dynamically using real-time data sources like **OpenTDB** and **Wikidata**. Unlike traditional trivia games where questions remain static until manually updated, this system continuously updates itself and leverages **Prolog** for reasoning and logical inference.

The result is a self-updating trivia game that provides **accurate, relevant, and challenging questions** while ensuring an engaging and educational experience.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Content Generation** – Questions are automatically generated from live sources such as Wikidata.  
- **Prolog Reasoning Engine** – Ensures questions are logically structured and contextually meaningful.  
- **SPARQL Integration** – Fetches and organizes knowledge graph data into machine-readable facts.  
- **Continuous Updates** – Keeps trivia fresh with an endless cycle of new question generation.  
- **Player Tracking** – Logs scores and streaks to encourage repeated play and progression.

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Periodically fetches new data from Wikidata using SPARQL.  
2. **Fact Transformation** – Converts raw data into Prolog-readable facts.  
3. **Reasoning & Question Generation** – Prolog infers connections and creates contextually relevant questions.  
4. **Game Interface** – Presents multiple-choice questions, verifies answers, and updates streaks.  
5. **Looping Cycle** – The process repeats, ensuring continuous freshness in gameplay.

## 📊 Results
- Generates **up-to-date trivia questions** grounded in factual data.  
- Provides **challenging, thought-provoking queries** rather than random facts.  
- Encourages player engagement through **streak-based scoring and progression tracking**.  
- Demonstrates the potential of combining the **Semantic Web + AI reasoning** for educational and entertainment purposes.
